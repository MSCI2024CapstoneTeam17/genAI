To balance supply with growing de-\\nmand, more food has to move from production to consumption sites. Moreover, demand for locally-grownfood is increasing and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks to develop and strengthen regional\\nandlocalfoodsystems. Thisarticleexamines wholesalefacility (hub)locationsinfoodsupplychainsystems\\non a national scale to facilitate the eﬃcient transfer of food from production regions to consumption loca-tions. It designs an optimal national wholesale or hub location network to serve food consumption markets\\nthrough eﬃcient connections with production sites. The mathematical formulation is a mixed integer linear\\nprogramming (MILP) problem that minimizes total network costs which include costs of transporting goodsand locating facilities. A scenario study is used to examine the model’s sensitivity to parameter changes,\\nincluding travel distance, hub capacity, transportation cost, etc. An application is made to the U.S. fruit and\\nvegetable industry. We demonstrate how parameter changes affect the optimal locations and number ofwholesale facilities.\\nPublished by Elsevier B.V.\\n1.

There are two possible transportation\\nmodes, namely land and air transfers, and food transportation cost\\nis a function of travel distance (impedance). Throughout this paper,we calculate travel distance as a function of impedance mileage (in-\\nstead of highway mileage); transportation occurs among wholesale\\nmarkets (hubs), production facilities (production/supply) and retailmarkets (consumption), all of which are located in speciﬁc counties.\\nWe consider travel from production sites to hubs and from hubs to\\nconsumptionsites.Onecountycanbeaproductionregion,ahubloca-tion, and/or a consumption site.

Considering the\\nrelatively high cost of establishing a hub, we expect that only a por-tionofpotentialhubcandidatesareselectedandmanypotentialhub\\ncandidateswouldberejected.Thefollowingheuristicisdevelopedto\\nuse thisideato considerablyreduce thecomputationaltime.\\nSimilartoanybranchandbound/cutalgorithms,weinitiallyrelax\\nthe integer variables (0 ≤Z\\nh≤1) of model ( M) and solve a relaxed\\nMILP (RMILP) as a linear programming problem. Let us refer to that\\nas model (RM). The solution to this model would potentially containsomeexcludednodeswith Z\\nh=0andsomepotentialhubswith Zh/negationslash=\\n0. The binary value of the former hubs ( Zh=0) suggests that they\\nwerenoteffectiveeveninarelaxedmodel;hence,weomitthesehubcandidatesfromthemodel( M)andbuildasmallersizedmodelcalled\\nIntermediate Model (IM). Naturally, this new model (IM) eliminates\\nZ\\nh,msih,mdhjvariablesandallassociatedconstraintsrelatedto Zh=0,\\nandcanbesolvedmuchfaster.Thisapproachwasalreadysuccessfully\\ntestedinindustrialsizeproblems( Susarla&Karimi,2012 ).Therefore\\nthereareclearincentivesfor applyingthatto our problem.\\nFromtheabovedescription, TCRM≤TC≤TCIM,andtheoptimality\\ngap ratio for model ( M) is deﬁned as |TCRM−TCIM|/TCRM. This can\\nbe used to measure the drift divergence from the optimal solution.\\nFig.3showsthealgorithmdescribedabove.\\n4.1.

The same approach was used for estimates of fresh\\nmarketfruit productioninU.S.counties,basedonannualproduction\\nstatistics of 34 different fresh market fruit and berry crops across 43\\nStates (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2009c ,2009d), and tables 31\\nand32oftheCensusdata( USDA/NASS,2009b ).Combinedproduction\\nforthesubsetofthese55cropsproducedineachcountyareconverted\\ntoacommonunit(tons)andsummedtoasingleproductionstatisticpercounty.\\nFruit and vegetable imports by county reﬂect the ports of un-\\nladingforall2007importsoffreshfruitsandvegetablecommodities,\\nobtainedfromthe“PortData”productpublishedbytheForeignTradeDivision of the U.S. Bureau of the Census ( www.census.gov/foreign-\\ntrade/).AllU.S.portsofunladingdatawereconvertedtotons,mapped\\nto a host county, and(whereapplicable)summedto a singlecounty-wide import statistic.

For exports, the coun-\\ntieshost oneormore internationalports ofdeparture.\\nConsumption in each county can be estimated by multiplying\\nU.S. per capital consumption of fruits and vegetables by county\\npopulation; however, since the model normalizes total consump-tion to total availability and assumes that food loss occurs at thesame rate between all production and consumption nodes, only\\nthe county population statistics are required. July 1, 2007 esti-\\nmates published by the U.S. Census Bureau are used for this purpose(http://www.census.gov/popest/ ).\\nBased on 2007 USDA/NASS data, a total of 2522 counties in the\\nUnited States contain fruit- or vegetable-producing farms. Some ofthe counties with larger farms also have higher production levels. In\\nthis study, production in 2007 is estimated to be 6,648,867 tons in\\nFresno County in California (1,682,763 tons of fruits and 4,966,104tonsofvegetables).Hence,totalfruitandvegetablesproductionfrom\\nallfarmsintheUnitedStatesiscalculatedas75,454,796tons.\\nFig. 4shows the continental U.S. fruit and vegetable production\\nmap.California,Florida,andWashingtonstateshavethehighestpro-duction level.

Conclusion and future work\\nThis paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)\\nmodel for ﬁnding optimal hub locations within a national logistics\\nsystem. A model is developed to minimize the total transportationcosts across two possible transportation modes, a standard low cost\\nmode (land based in the mnemonic) and a high cost mode that is\\nusedtoovercomelongdistanceshippingconstraintsassociatedwithhighly perishable cargo (air in the mnemonic). Considering the rela-\\ntively high cost of establishing a hub, only a subset of potential hub\\ncandidate locations are selected and many potential hub candidateswouldberejected.Becausetherearemanypossiblenode-hubcombi-\\nnationswithinanationalscalelogisticssystem,wedevelopaheuristic\\nsolutionalgorithmto reducecomputationalcosts.\\nOur ﬁndings allow us to draw several implications for the study\\nand development of regional food systems.

For example, going\\nfromcaseGtocaseJ( Table5)weﬁndthatwhenhubsareconstrained\\nto having at least a capacity of 100,000 tons and the maximum land\\nmode shipping distances decreases from 500 miles to 200 miles, the\\nnumber of supply nodes that exclusively ship by the higher cost airmode increases from 17 to 276. The reason is that, for many growers\\nthe geography that is cost effectively reachable by land shipments\\ndoes not contain a suﬃcient market to merit the establishment ofa hub. Air shipments greatly increase the marketable geography ofa regions production, so use of this mode would facilitate growersproducing for distant markets.

Researchers who ex-\\namine logistical systems on a national or global scale can adapt our\\nmodeling framework and heuristic solution algorithm approach torelatedresearchproblems.\\nFor the speciﬁc research questions discussed in this study, there\\nareclearareasofopportunitytoextendthemodelingapproach.First,the simplistic treatment of hub construction costs that served a use-\\nful purposeinthis study can bereplacedwithanempiricalapproach\\nthat treats hub construction and maintenance as an optimal invest-mentproblem,wherebytheconventionalcapitalizationformula(e.g.,\\nDevereux&Griﬃth,2003 )replacestheﬁxedcostspeciﬁcation.Using\\nthis approach, empirical analysis of shipping costs, wholesale mar-gins, and product volumes handled can be combined with ﬁnancialstatistics such as prevailing discount rates and capital depreciation\\nratesinordertotranslatethisdataintotheannualizedcostsofbuild-\\ning and maintaining a hub operation. With container shipping costpermilestatisticstypicallypublishedbyregionandcommodity(e.g.,\\nUSDA/AMS, 2014 ), this approach allows for the empirical calibration\\nof both hub operation costs and ton/mile shipping costs, which willfacilitateempiricallybasedestimatesofthecosttradeoffsthatdeter-\\nminespatialmarket outcomes inthemodel.\\nAnother closely related extension of this study is to account for\\neconomies of scale in handling costs of different sized hub opera-\\ntions. One example of an empirical model of this type is the holistic\\nmodelemployedby HaqueandEpplin(2012) thatencompassesfeed-\\nstockproductionandharvest,logisticservices(shippingandstorage),and bioreﬁnery investment (size and location). For our study, the in-\\nvestment problem can be addressed empirically using the same data\\nsourcesdiscussedabove.Translatingwholesalemargincoststocostsper unit handled and estimating linear cost functions for hub oper-\\nations of varying scales, two or more annualized hub cost function\\nspeciﬁcationscanbecompiled.Inthisapproach,thedecisiontobuildor not build a hub in a production or consumption node is expanded\\ntooneofnotbuildingahuborbuildingahubinoneofseveralpossible\\ncapacitiesandcost structures.\\nFinally, the simplistic approach in this study of treating fruit and\\nvegetableproductionasanon-differentiatedcommodityisproblem-\\natic. There are many varieties of both fruit and vegetable product asevidencedbythefactthatproductiondatausedforthisstudyincluded21vegetablevarietiesand34fruitandberryvarieties.Consumersdo\\nnot view these varieties as perfect substitutes and this has impor-\\ntantimplicationsforoptimalcommodityﬂowoutcomes.Problemsofthis type are common in studies of international and interregional\\ntrade (e.g., Helpman, 1998 ), and the prevailing empirical approach\\nis to specify a model of intra-industry trade, with (i) price sensitiveregionalconsumersdemandingproductvariety,(ii)regionalgrowers\\neach producing a differentiated product variety, (iii) regional sup-\\npliers (handling-distribution-logistics) providing increasing returnsto scale services, and (iv) transportation costs that increase with\\nimpedance weighted shipping distance. The model in this study and\\ntheextensionsdescribedaboveformeasuringeconomiesofscaleen-compassfeatures(ii)to(iv);however,hub-to-hubtradeﬂowsinthisstudy are determined by using a least cost objective function where\\nproductsfromanytworegionsareviewedasperfectsubstitutes.Ap-\\nproachestoincorporatefeaturesofthemodelofintra-industrytradeto capture the hub-to-hub trade ﬂow outcomes to problems of the\\ntype examined in this study represents another promising future di-\\nrection forthisresearch.\\nThe model in this study captures and sorts out the salient com-\\npeting forces affecting the endogenous spatial outcomes (hub lo-\\ncations, hub size, trade ﬂows, and technology constraints) of arepresentative national logistical system for fresh produce distri-\\nbution with over 2000 producing regions and over 3000 consump-tion regions. Some simplifying assumptions, such as product ho-\\nmogeneity across regions and exogenous ﬁxed unit cost trans-portation services, helped facilitate the scenario analysis, and it isimportant to keep these assumptions in mind as real-world policy\\nimplicationsandapplicationsaredeveloped.Approachesforrelaxing\\nthese simplifying assumptions were considered, and a survey of re-lated research provides a promising direction for future research on\\nthistopic.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Prof. I.A.
